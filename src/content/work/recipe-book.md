Developing a cookbook app was an exciting journey. Starting with gathering requirements, I analyzed them and created a plan for the development process.

To begin building the front-end of the app, I used ChakraUI, a powerful and flexible UI framework for React, to create reusable UI elements, allowing me to easily build complex pages and features. To power the app's backend, I selected Express, which provided me with a robust set of tools for handling HTTP requests, creating APIs, and managing server-side logic.

For the database, I chose Postgres, which allowed me to store and retrieve data efficiently and securely, while also providing features like data validation and foreign key constraints. To simplify my interactions with the database, I used Prisma, a modern ORM tool that provided a type-safe and intuitive way to work with Postgres.

Throughout the development process, I maintained a rigorous testing regimen to ensure the app was functioning as expected. Using a combination of automated and manual testing techniques, I was able to catch bugs and issues early on, allowing me to fix them quickly and avoid delays.

In the end, I was able to deliver a high-quality cookbook app that exceeded my expectations. By using ChakraUI, Express, Postgres, and Prisma, I built a powerful and scalable app that can handle large amounts of data and traffic while still providing a great user experience. I am proud of the work I have done and look forward to using these technologies to build even more impressive apps in the future.
