I am proud to showcase my work on the Mission Control app for my client. This cutting-edge application was developed using Vue.js and AWS, enabling users to send locations on a map to one of their vehicles and have them move autonomously to that point in the real world.

It was a multifaceted project that involved meticulous planning, designing, implementing, testing, and deployment phases. The team and I carefully defined the project's objectives, requirements, and constraints, and identified the features and functionality of the app. With a clear roadmap for development, we set out to build an app that would revolutionize the way people interact with their autonomous vehicles.

Vue.js was the natural choice for building the app's user interface, providing a flexible and robust platform for developing interactive and responsive applications. Leveraging the power of Vue.js, I created an intuitive user interface that seamlessly connected with AWS, providing a reliable and scalable backend infrastructure for the application.

Together with my client, we conducted extensive testing to ensure the app's reliability and performance, including unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. With meticulous attention to detail, I delivered an app that exceeded my clients' expectations, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for interacting with autonomous vehicles.

In conclusion, the Mission Control app is a testament to my expertise in software development and my commitment to delivering exceptional results. I am proud to showcase this project in my portfolio and look forward to demonstrating my skills on future projects.
