That's right, I am including this website on itself!
As a developer, I understand the importance of showcasing my skills and accomplishments in an easy-to-use and visually appealing format.

Before developing this portfolio I spent time brainstorming and thinking about what side of myself I wanted to show off, what kind of skills I could use, and how I wanted it all layed out.

After deciding that, I dived into development, breaking it down into smaller tasks and tackling them one by one. As I progressed, I regularly tested my website to ensure that it's responsive, accessible, and meets my requirements.

One of the essential aspects of a portfolio website is showcasing your work. So, I linked some old projects and works I've done to give you a comprehensive view of my skills.

Before deploying, I tested it thoroughly to ensure it's functioning as intended, testing its performance, accessibility, and responsiveness across different devices and browsers.

Finally, I deployed my website to Netlify using it's Github integration, ensuring it's secure and up-to-date.

This portfolio website is an ongoing project that requires maintenance. As I gain more experience and develop new projects, I'll update this website regularly to keep it up-to-date.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio website.
